# Assets

![Assets](images/assets.png)

**Assets** describe any entity that consumes energy. Arenas, administrative buildings,
and parks are all assets that may consume multiple energy types,
like electricity, natural gas, and water. EMILE can track multiple energy types
on each of the assets it tracks.

**Asset Groups** are a way to group together assets for the purpose of reporting on them together.
