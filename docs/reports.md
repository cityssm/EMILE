# Reports

EMILE offers several reporting options on the Reports page.

- **Formatted CSV Exports**<br />
  These reports omit deleted records, join together tables, and remove key fields used behind the scenes.

- **Raw Exports**<br />
  These reports include data as it exists in the backend database. They may contain deleted records
  that have not been fully purged from the database.

- **Power Query Integrations**<br />
  These reports are set up to be linked to from third party tools like Microsoft Excel.
  Once linked, the tool will be able to refresh the exported data automatically.
