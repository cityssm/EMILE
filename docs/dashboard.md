# EMILE Dashboard

![Dashboard](images/dashboard.png)

EMILE provides limited charting options, filtered by:

- Asset, Asset Category, or Asset Group.
- Start Date.
- End Date.

The data for each chart can be exported using the corresponding "Export" button.

Note that selecting a large number of assets and a large time range
can cause performance issues.  For more complex reporting, it is recommended to export the data
into a reporting application like Microsoft Excel or Microsoft Power BI.
